            <h1>Effects of Poverty</h1>

                <p>What does poverty do to those whom it affects?  When you hear the word "poverty", what might come to your mind are images of a family clothed in rags, or children who are so thin that you can see their bones protruding from their torso and their limbs.  You might even imagine a slum, full of dilapidated or haphazardly-built houses. What I just mentioned may be true in some cases, but the truth is, poverty does not always take the form of such descriptions. In fact, it can take the shape of a normal-looking family that does not appear to be struggling in some form, at least from the outside. There are many bad things that poverty can do to people. To me, the most important of these are family problems, illness and lack of education.</p>

                <p>First of all, poverty just makes families' lives harder. You see, running a household can cause a lot of stress, especially if you have a lot of children, and have to pay some bills here and there. Usually, it's not that bad, but when you are poor, things get much worse. You don't have enough money to feed your kids, or pay your bills before they're due, and that's what makes it sad.</p>

                <p>Secondly, since you don't have enough money to even buy anything for yourself or your family, you can't buy food, or even have adequate medical care. For the food part, you and your family are most likely malnourished because you don't receive enough nutrients to actually be healthy and not starving. Also, because you don't receive the medical care you need, you or your children are more likely to die earlier than people who aren't poor. How miserable!</p>

                <p>Lastly, your children don't get the education they need. Since you're struggling financially, of course, you can't afford standard-level education for your kids. But let's say you do. Chances are, they're still going to suffer. With all the struggles they have in their family, they're not going to perform well academically. And because of this, they're less likely to finish their education than wealthier children. And because their lack of education restricts them to the same living conditions they've had to endure since their childhood, this just repeats the cycle of hell that can go on for potentially many generations. </p>

                <p>With all that I have said, you might be wondering, why did I choose this topic to begin with? There are millions of people in this country that live in abject misery. Thus, I find it appropriate that I describe what happens to these people, so that you may know how bad it can get for them. </p>
