	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>Every day, I wake up at around 4:50 AM to start the day. After taking a bath, eating my breakfast, and spending 20 minutes defecating, 
			I pack up my belongings, don my uniform, as well as my jacket, then leave my house before locking the door. 
			I either drive in my car (or use public transportation in times when my car needs repair) to my workplace. 
			Usually, I would arrive 30-40 minutes before the official time, so I would have a lot of time to do other hobbies before I got to work. 
			Once it was time for business, I would find myself in front of my laptop, mainly reading and writing research articles for hours in silence.</p>

	    <section id="midday">
	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>As I have mentioned earlier, I would spend time reviewing and drafting research articles. 
			Sometimes, I am called to attend seminars or do various experiments. 
			My colleagues, most of the time, are usually enthusiastic and excited, but in other times, some of them seem half-asleep and inattentive, which is not really an uncommon sighting in my workplace. 
			Whenever I am called to take part in experiments, I would usually have my pen, paper and clipboard ready. 
			In these experiments, I would have to analyze and evaluate many things, and this is probably why I see many of my co-workers would look exhausted at the end of the shift.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      
	      <p>One time when I was clocking out of work, I did not realize that I had left my laptop in the room where I usually worked. 
			Only when I got home did I realize what I forgot to bring. 
			With no laptop to do some of my hobbies, I was left to watch television until I felt like it was my time to go to bed. 
			But as I prepared to lie down, someone knocked at my front door. 
			I opened it only to see one of my colleagues holding my laptop. 
			As it turned out, this coworker of mine was living in the same area as mine. 
			So after my laptop was returned, we bid each other farewell, before I went to bed.<p>
