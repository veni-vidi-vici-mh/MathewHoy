        <h3>Blinding Lights</h3>
        <h5>by The Weeknd</h5>

        <p>
            <em>Intro</em><br>
            Yeah
        </p>

        <p>
            I've been tryna call<br>
            I've been on my own for long enough<br>
            Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br>
            I'm goin' through withdrawals<br>
            You don't even have to do too much<br>
            You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Pre-chorus</em><br>
            I look around and<br>
            Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)<br>
            No one's around to judge me (Oh)<br>
            I can't see clearly when you're gone
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Chorus</em><br>
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
            I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
            Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
            Hey, hey, hey
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm running out of time<br>
            'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br>
             So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh 
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Pre-chorus</em><br>
            The city's cold and empty (Oh)<br>
            No one's around to judge me (Oh)<br>
            I can't see clearly when you're gone
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Chorus</em><br>
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
            I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
            Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Bridge</em><br>
            I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)<br>
            I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)<br>
            Will never let you go this time (Ooh) 
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Chorus</em><br>
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
            Hey, hey, hey
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Post-Chorus</em><br>
            Hey, hey, hey
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Outro</em><br>
            I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        </p>
